Software Design and Analysis (focused on Data Structure and Algorithm )

I thought of all the ways this data can be stored.
Then I thought of all the possible operations I might perform on my data and what kind of time and space complexity each data structure gives me.
Than as per my requirement I choose the appropriate data structure that I understood very well, I implemented the data structure analogy which provided a solution that sorted and printed out a list of the course in a computer science program in alphanumerical order
